MathUtil is a Java class that provides utility methods for performing various mathematical operations such as checking prime numbers, calculating GCD, finding Fibonacci numbers, and more. It includes both static and non-static methods, covering common tasks efficiently.

Methods
Static Methods:
isPrime(int n): Checks if n is a prime number.
gcd(int a, int b): Finds the greatest common divisor.
lcm(int a, int b): Finds the least common multiple.
fibonacci(int n): Returns the nth Fibonacci number.
factorial(int n): Calculates the factorial of n.
Non-static Methods:
isPerfectNumber(int n): Checks if n is a perfect number.
sumOfDigits(int n): Sums the digits of n.
reverseNumber(int n): Reverses the digits of n.
isArmstrongNumber(int n): Checks if n is an Armstrong number.
nextPrime(int n): Finds the next prime after n
